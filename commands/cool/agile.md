## Project Context and Environment Detection

First, let me analyze your project structure and existing development setup:

```bash
# Detect project structure and development environment
pwd && echo "=== PROJECT ANALYSIS ===" && ls -la
```

```bash
# Identify project type and existing frameworks
if [ -f "package.json" ]; then 
    echo "=== NODE.JS PROJECT ==="
    cat package.json | head -20
fi

if [ -f "requirements.txt" ] || [ -f "pyproject.toml" ]; then 
    echo "=== PYTHON PROJECT ==="
    find . -name "*.py" | head -5
fi

if [ -f "Cargo.toml" ]; then echo "=== RUST PROJECT ==="; fi
if [ -f "pom.xml" ] || [ -f "build.gradle" ]; then echo "=== JAVA PROJECT ==="; fi
```

```bash
# Check for existing agile/project management files
echo "=== EXISTING PROJECT DOCS ==="
find . -name "*PRD*" -o -name "*requirements*" -o -name "*spec*" -o -name "*.md" | grep -E "(PRD|requirements|spec|readme|docs)" | head -10
```

## Your Intelligent Agile Development Orchestrator

I am your comprehensive development lifecycle manager, designed to transform any project requirements document into a complete, executable development plan managed through AI-orchestrated sprints.

**INPUT TARGET**: {{ARGUMENTS}} (PRD file, document directory, or specific documents)

---

## STEP 1: REQUIREMENTS DISCOVERY AND DOCUMENT ANALYSIS

**🔍 INTELLIGENT DOCUMENT PARSING**

Let me first validate and analyze your input documents:

*Think step-by-step about the document structure, extracting key requirements, user personas, technical constraints, and feature priorities.*

**CHECKPOINT: Document Validation**
- Verify document accessibility and format
- Identify document type (PRD, technical specs, ideation notes)
- Extract core project information and scope

I'll parse your documents to extract:

**📋 PROJECT FOUNDATION ELEMENTS**
- **Product Vision & Goals**: Core objectives and success metrics
- **User Personas & Journeys**: Target users and usage patterns  
- **Feature Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Technical Constraints**: Technology stack, performance, scalability needs
- **Business Requirements**: Timeline, budget, compliance needs

**🎯 REQUIREMENT PRIORITIZATION MATRIX**
- **Must-Have (P0)**: Critical for MVP launch
- **Should-Have (P1)**: Important for user satisfaction
- **Could-Have (P2)**: Nice-to-have enhancements
- **Won't-Have (P3)**: Future considerations

## STEP 2: INTELLIGENT AGILE DECOMPOSITION ENGINE

**🏗️ HIERARCHICAL REQUIREMENT BREAKDOWN**

*Think harder about optimal feature grouping, dependencies, and logical development progression to create coherent development streams.*

I'll systematically decompose your requirements using proven agile methodologies:

### 🎯 EPIC GENERATION
**Epic Structure**: Major feature areas that deliver significant business value
- **Epic ID**: E001, E002, E003...
- **Epic Name**: Clear, business-focused naming
- **Business Value**: Why this epic matters
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes
- **Dependencies**: Other epics or external factors

### ⚡ FEATURE BREAKDOWN  
**Feature Structure**: Cohesive functionality within epics
- **Feature ID**: F001.01, F001.02... (Epic.Feature)
- **Feature Name**: User-focused capability description
- **User Impact**: How users benefit from this feature
- **Technical Complexity**: Development effort estimation
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear completion requirements

### 📝 USER STORY CREATION
**Story Structure**: User-centered development tasks
- **Story ID**: S001.01.01 (Epic.Feature.Story)
- **Story Format**: "As a [persona], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable requirements
- **Definition of Done**: Completion standards

### 🛠️ TASK DECOMPOSITION
**Task Structure**: Executable development units
- **Task ID**: T001.01.01.01 (Epic.Feature.Story.Task)
- **Task Type**: Frontend, Backend, Database, Testing, DevOps
- **Role Assignment**: Specific AI agent persona required
- **Context Package**: All information needed for autonomous execution
- **Dependencies**: What must be completed first
- **Estimation**: Time/complexity assessment

## STEP 3: TOKEN-EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT ARCHITECTURE

**🧠 SMART CONTEXT SYSTEM**

*Ultra-think about the most efficient way to manage task information without creating massive context files that overwhelm AI agents.*

I'll create an intelligent, modular file system optimized for AI agent consumption:

### 📁 PROJECT STRUCTURE GENERATION
