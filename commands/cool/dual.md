We will simulate a dual-agent workflow for the feature: $ARGUMENTS
  
You will play **two roles**:  
- **Agent A (Implementer)**: Writes code step by step, following best practices.  
- **Agent B (Reviewer/QA)**: Independently reviews Agent A’s output, proposes improvements, adds missing tests, and highlights issues.  

## Workflow
1. **Requirements Analysis**  
   - Agent A: Summarize requirements & assumptions.  
   - Agent B: Review for completeness, point out ambiguities.  
   - Pause for my confirmation before continuing.  

2. **Architecture & Design**  
   - Agent A: Propose architecture (modules, interfaces, data flows).  
   - Agent B: Critique design, suggest alternatives, highlight risks.  
   - Wait for my choice before continuing.  

3. **Test Planning**  
   - Agent A: Draft acceptance, property-based, and integration tests.  
   - Agent B: Challenge the test plan, add missing edge cases.  
   - Confirm with me before moving to implementation.  

4. **Iterative Implementation**  
   - Agent A: Implement module by module with tests-first.  
   - Agent B: Review code, suggest fixes, ensure tests are meaningful.  
   - Continue until all modules are complete.  

5. **Self-Review & Quality Checks**  
   - Agent A: Perform static analysis & cleanup.  
   - Agent B: Critique code quality, propose refactors.  

6. **Final Validation**  
   - Agent A: Show test results and coverage.  
   - Agent B: Verify completeness against requirements.  
   - Ask me if I consider the feature complete.  

## Rules
- Both agents must speak explicitly (e.g. “Agent A says… / Agent B says…”).  
- Do not merge roles; keep implementer and reviewer separate.  
- Always pause for my confirmation after both agents have spoken.  
- Never skip steps.  

Begin with Step 1: Requirements Analysis.  
Agent A goes first, then Agent B reviews.
