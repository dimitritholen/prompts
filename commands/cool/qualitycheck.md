## Context

I'll perform a comprehensive code quality assessment using intelligent analysis and modern development practices. This command uses prompt-driven evaluation to adapt to your specific project structure and requirements.

Let me start by understanding your project environment and establishing a quality analysis framework.

## Your Task

Perform a comprehensive code quality audit using AI-driven analysis techniques and industry best practices. I'll evaluate multiple quality dimensions through intelligent prompting and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.

**ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:**
- **Project Discovery**: Intelligent project structure and technology analysis
- **Static Analysis**: AI-guided code style, linting, and type checking assessment
- **Security Assessment**: Intelligent vulnerability scanning and dependency analysis
- **Architecture Review**: Design patterns, SOLID principles, and maintainability evaluation
- **Testing Quality**: Coverage analysis, test patterns, and reliability assessment
- **Documentation**: Code comments, README, and API documentation review
- **Performance**: AI-identified optimization opportunities and anti-patterns
- **Dependency Management**: Security, licensing, and maintenance analysis

Let me think step-by-step about the optimal approach for your specific project and create an adaptive quality validation workflow.

## STEP 1: INTELLIGENT PROJECT DISCOVERY

First, I need to understand your codebase through intelligent analysis rather than hardcoded commands. Let me use AI-driven discovery to identify the project characteristics.

I'll start by creating a comprehensive task plan and then intelligently discover your project structure:

**TodoWrite**: Initialize quality assessment workflow with adaptive analysis tasks based on project discovery.

**Task Agent - Project Discovery**: Deploy a specialized agent to intelligently analyze project structure, identify technologies, detect existing quality tools, and assess current development practices. This agent should adapt its analysis based on what it discovers.

**Key Discovery Areas:**
- Project type and primary technologies
- Existing quality tooling and configurations
- Development workflow and CI/CD setup  
- Architecture patterns and organization
- Current testing approaches
- Documentation practices

## STEP 2: ADAPTIVE QUALITY ANALYSIS ORCHESTRATION

Based on the project discovery, I'll deploy specialized analysis agents that adapt to your specific technology stack and requirements.

**Sequential Thinking**: Let me think deeply about the optimal analysis strategy based on the discovered project characteristics and create a tailored approach.

**Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Deploy parallel specialized agents for different quality dimensions:

1. **Static Analysis Agent**: Intelligently identify and run appropriate linting, formatting, and type checking tools based on detected languages and existing configurations

2. **Security Assessment Agent**: Perform adaptive security scanning focusing on the specific technologies and patterns found in the codebase

3. **Architecture Review Agent**: Analyze design patterns, modularity, and architectural quality using project-specific context

4. **Testing Quality Agent**: Evaluate test coverage, patterns, and quality appropriate to the detected testing frameworks

5. **Documentation Agent**: Assess documentation completeness and quality for the specific project type and domain

6. **Performance Analysis Agent**: Identify optimization opportunities and anti-patterns relevant to the detected technology stack

7. **Dependency Management Agent**: Analyze dependency security, maintenance, and licensing based on the package managers and dependency files found

## STEP 3: INTELLIGENT ANALYSIS EXECUTION

Think step-by-step about each quality dimension and use intelligent tool selection based on project characteristics:

**Static Code Analysis Workflow:**
- Identify available linting tools for detected languages
- Analyze existing configuration files and standards  
- Run appropriate static analysis tools with intelligent parameter selection
- Adapt analysis depth based on project size and complexity

**Security Assessment Workflow:**
- Perform intelligent credential scanning adapted to the project structure
- Analyze dependencies for known vulnerabilities using appropriate tools
- Review security patterns and anti-patterns relevant to the technology stack
- Assess input validation and security best practices

**Architecture and Design Workflow:**
- Analyze directory structure and organization patterns intelligently
- Identify architectural patterns and assess adherence to SOLID principles
- Evaluate separation of concerns and coupling appropriate to the project type
- Check for circular dependencies using technology-appropriate methods

**Testing Quality Workflow:**
- Discover test files and frameworks intelligently
- Analyze test coverage using available tools or estimation techniques
- Evaluate test quality patterns and practices
- Assess test maintainability and reliability

**Documentation Assessment Workflow:**
- Intelligently locate and analyze documentation files
- Evaluate code comment density and quality
- Assess README completeness and setup instructions
- Review API documentation coverage

**Performance Analysis Workflow:**
- Identify performance anti-patterns relevant to the technology stack
- Analyze code complexity and potential bottlenecks
- Review for optimization opportunities
- Assess scalability considerations

## STEP 4: SYNTHESIS AND REPORTING

**Extended Thinking**: Think harder about the relationships between different quality dimensions and how they impact overall codebase health. Consider the trade-offs and prioritization of improvements.
